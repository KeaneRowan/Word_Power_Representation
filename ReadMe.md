#Using this Repository
- spaCy sense2vec repo files from 2015 are inside the spaCyVectors directory
- Rankings directory contains the 200 handcrafted datapoints
- Rankings directory also contains AutoGeneratedRankings which is the 200 datapoints from before as well as some predictions the model has made for testing purposes
- Model_Versions is where you will point train_model() to bring in the pretrained model 

#Understanding main.py
- generate_more_data(): Exactly what it sounds like --> grabs unused spaCy vectors and guesses their power
- train_model(): Trains the model (pulls it from Model_Versions) and updates it for 30 epochs (this will take a while)
- train_test_split(): Needed for train_model, should not be tweaked

#MISC Important Points
- Updates to this repo will occur once I have a dataset of over 20000 points if any are interested in downloading
- All paths are relative and shouldn't need to be updated unless you are following gitignore (which will exclude the automatically generated file)
